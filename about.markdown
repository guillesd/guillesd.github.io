Hi:wave: I'm Guillermo, a Spaniard living in Amsterdam working in the data industry. What is this place? Well, this is just a blog where I write things related to tech or about tech. I do this on my own, not using LLMs to write stuff for me. The only thing I allow LLMs to do is to check my spelling and grammar mistakes &mdash;I am not a native speaker, bear with me&mdash;.

I will do my best to provide you with accurate information and my most honest, hype-free opinions. Why hype-free? Because there’s already an abundance of overhyped opinions in tech, like *"this is the best new tool you didn’t know you needed"* or *"why AGI is going to take your job."* I’m not a fan of that, and therefore I will stay away from making sweeping generalizations or crazy bold claims that are supported only by thin air.
